          <p>Other than my passion for coding, I recently began collecting vinyls! Since a kid I&apos;ve always enjoyed music
            and now I can collect it in its purest form...on vinyl! So far my collection is small with about 10 records, but I 
            plan to increase my collection for many years to come. To the right you can see some of my favorite albums in my
            collection! &#128513; <br />

            Why Vinyl? <br />
            <br />
            In my opinion music should be listened to on vinyl. It adds a completely different layer of sound and appreciation 
            for the inspiring work these artists make. In fact, this very website is inspired by some of my favorite albums. The 
            simple nature, colorful visuals, and satisfaction of the process all come from my favorite bodies of work. If I&apos;m
            lucky, I will have the opportunity to merge my passion for music and code in future projects and endeavors.
